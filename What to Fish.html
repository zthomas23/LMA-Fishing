    <h1>What to Fish</h1>
    <div class="basic">

        <h2>Bluegill</h2>

        <p>Bluegill are the smallest fish that can be fished for, but they are still fun, especially for beginners. Anywhere along the 
            coast will have bluegill. I find around blueberry point there are a lot of bluegill and they can be found in nests, which 
            is when they are most aggressive. Small jigs will work and worms work very well. I find that fly fishing in very shallow 
            water (1-2 feet) can lead to lots of catches and a fun day. However, in general, a closed face or spinning rod with a jig 
            or worm will work best. They stay small so light line and gear will be the best. They can fight hard and they are some of 
            the prettiest fish in the lake so they are great fish even though they are small.</p>

        <h2>Catfish</h2>


        <p>Catfish can be some of the hardest fighting fish, and some of the biggest. They hunt by scent so fishing with catfish 
            scented bait or live bait. They can be caught trolling but if you’re specifically targeting catfish, scented bait out deep 
            is the most effective strategy. For example, hot dogs work even though it sounds weird. Make sure whatever bait you use 
            gets down to the bottom. As for rods, you need something fairly large to be able to handle a large fish. So, big spinning 
            rods or baitcasters are the best. Heavier line should also be used because of the size and because they can’t see the line 
            very well. While not a conventional game fish, they are a very fun fish to fish in Lake Mokoma.</p>
    </div>

        <img id="basic-pic" height="300px" width="auto" src="Images/jesswithcrappie.png">

        <h2>Crappie</h2>

        <p>Crappies are a great fish to eat, fun to catch, and can get big. Even better, fishing for them isn’t very difficult. 
            Structure in deep water is where you will most likely find these fish. Underneath the big dock is a hotspot, for example, 
            as long as you are cautious of swimmers. Any deep lily pads will also hold fish. Jigs or small spinners work great for 
            crappies. Jigging or trolling will work well but I find jigging will work best. If you want to use live bait, minnows or 
            even worms will work great. A small spinning rod or closed face rod will be sufficient for them. Line of at least 6 lb test 
            will work. Most of these are around 8 inches but there are some the size of dinner plates. They also fight very hard for 
            their size so these are one of the most fun fish to catch in Lake Mokoma.</p>

        <h2>Largemouth Bass</h2>

        <p>Largemouth bass are one of, if not the most popular game fish. They are so much fun to fish for and catch. Best of all, 
            there are plenty of large healthy largemouth bass in Lake Mokoma. Ranging from babies the size of minnows to over 20 inch 
            fish, they all put up a fight. They will even jump on the end of your line trying to escape. So, how do you catch them?</p>
            <p>Bass can be caught in many different ways depending on when and where you are fishing, but looking for cover works best. 
            Anywhere where smaller fish can hide is where these predators will be. If you can find structure in or near deep water, 
            it is almost guaranteed to hold fish. For example, deep lily pads and submerged stumps are great to hold fish. You can find 
            plenty of bass in shallow water as well, often in the shade of lily pads, docks, or trees. Trolling out deep can also work, 
            especially in the heat of the summer.</p> <p>For lures, my personal favorites are spinnerbaits and wacky rigged senkos.Chartreuse, 
            purple, and brown with red flakes are my favorite colors but any will work. Plenty of other lures will work 
            as well. In the spring and fall when fish are aggressive, surface lures such as jitterbugs and buzzbaits can work, or are 
            at least fun to use. Other soft plastics work as well, such as sluggos and any salamander or crayfish impersonation. Jerk 
            baits and crank baits can also be effective but avoiding weeds and stumps can be an issue.</p> <p>These fish can get big, so make 
            sure your rod and line is capable of handling bigger fish. 8-12 lb test should suffice. Spinning rods are great for plastics 
            while baitcasters are good for spinnerbaits, crankbaits, and buzzbaits, but both could be used for either. With practice, 
            you will find tricks and strategies that work for you. I highly recommend trying bass fishing because catching and fishing 
            for them is so much fun.</p>

        <h2>Perch</h2>

        <p>Perch are great fish to eat and are fun to fish for. Perch are known to school in deeper water. In this lake, you can find 
            them anywhere deep such as straight out from the castle. They are on the smaller side, 6-8 inches is average, but there are 
            some bigger. Knowing this, the best strategy for these fish are small jigs. Trolling with small inline spinners can work 
            and live bait should work really well for these fish. Make sure your lure is getting deep enough for these fish using 
            weight and by jigging. Since perch are schooling fish, if you find one, there will most likely be other fish nearby. This 
            can be great for beginners and young fishermen because a simple jig and closed-face reel can catch many of these fish. And, 
            if you can catch a lot, they are great to eat so I highly recommend trying perch fishing. </p>

        <img id="basic-pic1" height="300px" width="auto" src="Images/mewithpickerel.png">

        <h2>Pickerel</h2>

        <p>Pickerels used to rule the lake but the population and size of these fish are down, but you can still find some monsters. 
            These fish are really aggressive and territorial. So lures that bring a reaction from these fish work best such as 
            spinnerbaits. Surface lures such as jerkbaits, buzzbaits, and jitterbugs are also effective. Baitcasters are the best for 
            these fish because they are the best for the lures used and can easily handle even a large pickerel. Heavier line is also 
            recommended in order to handle larger fish and prevent their teeth from cutting the line. To find pickerels, fish in 
            shallow water in shade such as under trees, docks, or in lilly pads. Anywhere along the coast is good for finding pickerel 
            but the cove of Conklin Run and around Blueberry Point are both great spots. These fish are often considered pests because 
            they are big, toothy, and compete with the bass but they are still a fun fish to catch.</p>

        <h2>Smallmouth Bass</h2>

        <p>Smallmouth bass are probably the hardest-fighting fish when they are caught, making them super fun to catch. Though there isn’t 
        a lot in Lake Mokoma nor are they super large, you can still find them. These fish like deep, clear, cold water and Lake Mokoma 
        doesn’t have much of that so catching them is more likely in the fall and spring when the water is cooler and clearer. Looking 
        for rocky bottoms can work. Their primary food source is crayfish so using plastic crayfish works well. Crankbaits also work 
        well when they are drug across rocks and spinnerbaits can work too. TRDs rigged as dropshots also work really well but they are 
        both prone to weeds and getting stuck. Baitcasters or spinning rods should be used because of how hard the fish fight. As for 
        where, anywhere rocky with cool water should hold fish such as the dam and around the castle. However, it’s hard to target 
        these fish in Lake Mokoma because they are fairly scarce. Normally, I fish for largemouth bass and sometimes will catch a 
        smallmouth. It’s always a welcome surprise though, because these fish fight really hard, no matter their size.</p>

        <h2>Walleye</h2>

        <p>Walleye were originally added to the lake to help control the perch population, but they have established themselves in the 
            lake. They can be huge, over 20 inches, and fight hard, always trying to get to deep water. They look evil and have big 
            teeth and rough body, so be careful when you catch one. In order to catch them, slow trolling in deep water with spoons or 
            even plastics works well. Oftentimes, when fishing for bass, you can catch a walleye. Walleye can be found anywhere in deep 
            water but near submerged cover such as stumps are where fish are most likely to be found. Nightcrawlers in deep water can 
            also be very fun. Since these fish are large, you need a bigger rod with at least 10 lb test. Baitcasters or spinning rods 
            are recommended. Walleye’s teeth can cut through the line so use a heavier line or a leader. Walleye are also great to eat, 
            making them one of the most fun fish in Lake Mokoma.</p>
