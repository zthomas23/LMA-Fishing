        <p>This region of the lake is marked by deep lily pads and submerged stumps. In the shallows around blueberry point you can find largemouth, bluegill, and pickerel. Fishing in the shallows is great for bass and pickerel due to the lily pads and stumps. Bass and bluegill also often spawn here in the springtime due to the deep water off the coast. Fishing with spinnerbaits around the public docks is good for pickerel or largemouth bass. Fishing from the public docks is easy and convenient yet can still lead to lots of fish. Using senkos or any sinking plastic lure in deep lily pads should work very well. Trolling in deep water with jigs is a great way to catch crappie, perch, walleye, or even bass. In the summer months, fishing in the middle with subtle lures works because of the cooler water and submerged structure. The amount of structure and deep water leads to some very large fish, making this perhaps the best place to fish in the lake.
