            <p>This part of the lake is covered with docks, trees overhanging the water, and lily pads. There is some deep water off the coast and some structure here for fish to hide. Streams flowing into the lake provide cool, oxygen rich water so they normally hold fish. Near the beach, there is some rocky bottom and submerged sticks making it great for bass, both smallmouth and largemouth. Overhanging trees provide shade for pickerel and some largemouth. Deep lily pads near the castle provide structure for largemouth bass and some very large crappie. Perch can be found in deeper water near submerged stumps with jigs. Fly fishing for bluegill in shallow waters can be fun while plastics will work for bass. More aggressive lures such as crankbaits or spinnerbaits will work for pickerel and bass. Fishing with live bait out deep is great for crappie and live bait from docks is sure to produce bluegill. This portion of the lake is slightly shallower, yet structures such as stumps, trees, docks, and lily pads provide for some great fishing.
