        <p>While the lake doesnt get very deep here, there is still some great fishing here due to cover along the shore. At the very end of blueberry point, a small cove with lily pads and sticks provides great structure for smaller fish such as crappie and perch, though bass can be found as well. Further along the coast, docks and fallen trees will hold pickerel and largemouth bass, which is a great spot for really windy days because the point provides cover. The cove where Conklin Run flows into the lake is very shallow and muddy, yet I find it great for largemouth during the spring spawning season. It does get covered in lily pads during the summer which provides good structure for fish. Out deep on the end of Blueberry Point, trolling can produce larger largemouth bass and walleye. Jigging, especially near the big dock and lily pads, will always catch smaller panfish and some large crappie. While it can be shallow and muddy, you can always find fish in deeper water and in cover.
