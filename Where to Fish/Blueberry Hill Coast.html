        <img class="map" src="../Images/5selectedmap.png">
        <p class="map-text">From the sailboat docks down to the dam, the coast is covered with sticks and lily pads with deep water nearby. The sailboat docks hold smaller fish such as bluegill but around Blueberry Hill, the coast drops off quickly to deep water. There is a beaver lodge, which provides amazing structure and food for fish. There are also bushes, sticks, lily pads, and trees all along the coast which provide shelter for the fish. With deep water nearby, this makes a great habitat for largemouth and smallmouth bass. They can be caught with plastics while more aggressive bass and pickerel can be found using spinnerbaits. Out deeper, there is crappie, perch, and walleye, which can be caught with live bait or jigs. You can catch anything fishing from the public dock or even from the beach. Live bait and even jigs in shallow waters are sure to find bluegill. With excellent structure along the coast and deep water nearby, this portion of the lake is a great habitat for fish year round.
