        <p>This is by far the shallowest portion of the lake, only reaching around 6 feet at its deepest point. However, it has a lot of cover. It is full of sticks, overhanging trees, lily pads, and stumps. On the west shore, there is a cove with multiple trees in the lake, stumps, and deeper lily pads which are great for largemouth. This can be a great place in the spring or fall when the water is colder and fish are shallower. Structure in shallow water leads to lots of bass, pickerels, and bluegill in here but not many perch, crappie, or walleye. So, plastics such as senkos and spinnerbaits in or near lily pads and stumps are the most effective strategies. Further down the east shore, the water will get deeper but the shore still has lots of cover making it one of the best places to fish in Lake Mokoma. Along the west shore, coastlines covered in fallen down trees house largemouth. All in all, this portion can be too shallow and weedy during the summer, yet the fishing here can still be amazing.
